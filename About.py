The DBS Vision App allows you to perform computer vision analysis of dried blood spot size and shape, using images obtained using a Revvity Panthera puncher.

Use the sidebar to navigate between pages:
- Understanding how to configure the app and determine the instrument specific pixel-mm conversion factor
- Uploading and analysing single images of dried blood spots and viewing an annotated image
- Analysing multiple images and exporting DBS quality metrics as .csv file
- Simple analysis of the .csv file to produce summary statistics on DBS quality and show DBS diameter distribution
- Time series analysis of a .csv file to assess time
