The DBS Vision App allows you to perform computer vision analysis of dried blood spot size and shape, using images obtained using a Revvity Panthera 9 puncher.

Use the sidebar to navigate between pages:


| Page | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Configuration** | Understanding how to configure the app and determine the instrument-specific pixel-mm conversion factor. |
| **External Calibration** | Calculating the instrument-specific pixel-mm conversion factor using an external standard. |
| **Single Image Analysis** | Uploading and analysing single images of dried blood spots and viewing an annotated image. |
| **Multiple Image Analysis** | Analysing multiple images and exporting DBS quality metrics as a .csv file. |
| **Data Analysis** | Simple analysis of the .csv file to produce summary statistics on DBS quality and show DBS diameter distribution. |
| **Time Series Analysis** | Time series analysis of a .csv file to assess time-based trends in DBS quality. |
